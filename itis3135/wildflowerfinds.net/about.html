                Natalie and Laura met in college and became friends through their thrifting hobby! Once they started thrifting together 
                they kept finding fun thrifts that just didn't fit their style. This led them to start a small business together focused 
                on sharing all cute and unique finds found on their thrifting journeys together! Since then, they have enjoyed the excuse 
                of the Wildflower Finds to go on as many thrifting trips as possible together, finding so much joy in growing their 
                community and your closet!
