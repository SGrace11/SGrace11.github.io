            <h2>Course Contract</h2>
            <p>I, <a href="introduction.html">Sarah L. Grace</a> agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my 
                Spring 2022, ITIS 3135, Web-Based App Design and Development course with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Breisen.</p>
            <p>I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online tooks will be available to the world, 
                and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.</p>
            <p>I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. 
                As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.</p>
            <p>I also understand that given the structure and content of this class it's possible to find many examples online 
                or even view my classmates' code directly. I swear that I will only use these resources to learn, and will not cut 
                and paste code except where I have properly given credit (i.e. externam libraries) and never from my classmates.</p>
            <p>Signed: <em>Sarah L. Grace, 25/01/2022</em></p>
